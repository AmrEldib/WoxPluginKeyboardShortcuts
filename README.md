# Keyboard Shortcuts Plugin for Wox

This is a plugin for the Windows launcher [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox).  
It lets users quickly search for keyboard shortcuts for a number of programs.  

## Use
Type 
```
sc program function
```
where `program` is the name of the program, and `function` is what you're trying to do.  
For example, to find the shortcuts for tabs in Firefox, search for:  
```
sc firefox tab 
```
